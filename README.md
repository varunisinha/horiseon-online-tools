## Description
In this project, you will find a Horiseon webpage application that showcases the online services provided by our client Horiseon in today's competitive market. This includes Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The code provided by the client has been refactored to allow for SEO best practices, improve the site's efficiency, readibility, and accessibility.

## Refactored code
A concise and descriptive title tag has been introduced in the head of html code. A meta tag has also been added to improve SEO. The page has only one H1 tag and the anchor text of internal links on the page relay what the website is about, thus improving search engine optimization. HTML semantic elements such as header, nav, article, section, aside, and footer have been introduced for better page organization. Descriptive alt tags have been refactored to improve accessibility. Selectors (class and id) have been edited/consolidated to group content with similar styling and improve website efficiency. 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
